# AI Assistance Disclosure:
# Tool: GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
# Date: 2025-11-07
# Scope: Assisted in generation the Nginx server configuration for the PeerPrep frontend. 
# Optimized location blocks for static asset caching, API proxying to the gateway, 
# and WebSocket forwarding to the collaboration service.
# Author review: I verified proxy routing accuracy, adjusted cache directives for consistency 
# with development needs, and ensured compatibility with Dockerized service networking.
