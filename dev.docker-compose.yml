# Scope: Generated descriptive and structured comments for the `dev.docker-compose.yml` file, 
# outlining its purpose, usage scenarios, and developer guidance for database-only configuration. 
# System architecture, service boundaries, and design decisions were independently determined by the team prior to AI assistance.
# Author review: I verified the technical accuracy of comment, 
# and refined phrasing to ensure consistency with project documentation style.

# ============================================
# Database-Only Docker Compose Configuration
# ============================================
# This file is for running ONLY the PostgreSQL database.
# Use this when you want to:
# - Run backend services locally (npm start) while using containerized database
# - Debug services without rebuilding containers
# - Faster startup during development
#
# Usage: docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d
#
# For running the COMPLETE application (recommended), use: docker-compose.yml
# ============================================
